After earning multiple IT certifications, I realized I needed hands-on experience. So I started Andrew Ramdall’s Network+ course to build a strong foundation.

Here’s what I’ve learned so far:
- OSI Model
- Ports & Protocols
- IP Addressing

I’m using Cisco Packet Tracer and blogging my journey here. Stay tuned!
